                            <p>We are happy to ship worldwide. Our shipping service is fast and professional, and includes tracking. International customers are responsible for any and all taxes, duties, or other additional fees associated with the delivery. We are not able to send international packages marked as a gift, or with any stated value other than the actual invoice value of the package. All the parts we sell are designed for use on vehicles originally sold in the USA. We cannot guarantee correct fitment for any part outside the USA. We are happy to help you confirm fitment, and verify your part numbers before you purchase. If you have any questions, please contact us. We have happy customers in nearly every country in the world.</p>

                            <p>In accordance with applicable state and local laws, we are required to charge sales tax. BuyAutoParts.com does not benefit from the collection of sales taxes and we remit the taxes collected directly to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.<br>
                                As a rule, it is the laws of the state of delivery that determine whether sales tax will be due on your transaction. Taxes that appear in your online order confirmation are estimated. The actual taxes charged to your credit card will be calculated based on the applicable state and local sales taxes when your order is shipped.</p>
